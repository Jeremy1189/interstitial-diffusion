Interstitial diffusion is a pivotal process that governs the phase stability and irradiation response of materials in non-equilibrium conditions. In this work, we study sluggish and chemically-biased interstitial diffusion in Fe-Ni concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) by combining machine learning (ML) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC), where ML is used to accurately and efficiently predict the migration energy barriers of interstitials on-the-fly. By comprehensively analyzing the diverse migration patterns of interstitial dumbbells, we find that the observed sluggish diffusion and the "Ni-Ni-Ni" biased diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys are ascribed to a unique "Barrier Lock" mechanism, whereas the "Fe-Fe-Fe" biased diffusion is influenced by a "Component Dominance" mechanism. Additionally, a practical AvgS-kMC method, that relies only on the mean of migration patterns’ energy barriers, and an inverse design approach, that optimizes sluggish diffusion properties, are proposed for efficiently and conveniently exploring the interstitial-mediated diffusion behaviors and properties in CSAs.
